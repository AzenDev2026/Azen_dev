## ALRM — Azen Laptop Resources Management

ALRM is a system-level resource management technology for laptops.
It reduces background process activity and manages sleep behavior
to improve battery life and responsiveness.

Key features:

- **App Nap** — Freezes idle background applications
- **Deep Sleep** — Configures system sleep mode based on hardware
- **Resource Optimization** — Adjusts background process priority

Written in C++17. See [ALRM/README.md](ALRM/README.md) for details.

## ALPRM — Azen Laptop Power Resources Management

ALPRM is the next generation of ALRM. It aims to replace the
fragmented Linux sleep stack with a unified, Azen-controlled
power management framework.

Current progress:

- Monitoring Layer (C) — listens to lid, power button, and D-Bus sleep events
- Decision Layer (Rust) — state machine, permission checks, handoff logs
- Execution Layer (C + Rust) — process freezing, sleep mode switching, hardware control

See [ALPRM/README.md](ALPRM/README.md) for details.

## AlreSearch — System File Search Engine

AlreSearch is an early-stage search engine for system files. It is
designed to be fast and lightweight, with a focus on low resource
usage.

See [AlreSearch/README.md](AlreSearch/README.md) for details.

## Wtml — Terminal Tool

Wtml is a terminal-based tool for web template markup. It is
currently in early development.

See [Wtml/README.md](Wtml/README.md) for details.
